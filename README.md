## Introduction
A recent article on Forbes magazine highlights the problem of missing medical appointments. One study found that medical no-shows cost the United  States healthcare system more than $150 billion a year and individual physicians an average of $200 per unused time slot. Apart from the economic issue, there is also consider the individual implications of no-shows on health. When patients miss appointments, continuity of care is interrupted. Medication efficacy can’t be monitored regularly. Preventive services and screenings can’t be delivered in a timely manner. Acute illnesses are more likely to go untreated and become chronic conditions with complications. In short, missing an appointment can be severely detrimental to one’s health. At the European level there are some small unicentric studies that signal the same problem and an equivalent economic cost. 

## Objective
To create a Machine Learning algorithm to predict medical appointment No-shows, thus, reducing health and economic impact of this phenomenon
